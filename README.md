# Dunsel-Network

## Brief Description
Dunsel Network is a fully functional template of image-sharing, community based, social network: after a sign in process, the user is given a personal account, where he can post photos and manage profile's setting, such as description and profile image. Moreover, he can search for other user via search bar.
But this social is more inclined on enhancing interactions and discussion: on the homepage the user can create his own communities and search for other ones, and join them as well. Once the user is a member of the community, he can add his own posts, with descriptions, and start discussions in the comment section.
The last posts of the communities are shown in the homepage feed.

## Technologies
Dunsel Network is a MERN Stack application: the server side is based on NodeJS and Express, the storage relies on MongoDB and the frontend stands on React (Vite application).
The authentication system utilizes Bcrypt and JWT.
